<div class="panel">
  <p class="panel-title">Page 1: A Salty Surprise</p>
  <p><strong>Scene:</strong> Safi and Tayo are in a bright, cosy kitchen, surrounded by colourful African dishes like jollof rice and plantains.</p>
  <p><strong>Safi:</strong> “Tayo, did you know too much salt can actually harm our hearts and kidneys?”</p>
  <p><strong>Tayo (surprised):</strong> “Really? Salt makes food yummy, but I had no idea it could be harmful!”</p>
  <p><strong>Baba (entering, holding a wooden spoon):</strong> “Yes, little ones. Salt gives flavour, but we must be careful. Let’s become Salt Busters and learn how to eat well without too much salt!”</p>
</div>

<div class="panel">
  <p class="panel-title">Page 2: Understanding the Problem</p>
  <p><strong>Scene:</strong> A cartoon heart and kidneys look tired, weighed down by a giant saltshaker.</p>
  <p><strong>Narrator:</strong> “Too much salt makes our hearts and kidneys work harder than they should.”</p>
  <p><strong>Safi (pointing to a chart):</strong> “See, if we reduce salt, we keep them strong and healthy!”</p>
  <p><strong>Tayo (thoughtful):</strong> “I want a strong heart and body. So how do we know how much salt we’re eating?”</p>
</div>

<div class="panel">
  <p class="panel-title">Page 3: Spotting Sneaky Salt</p>
  <p><strong>Scene:</strong> Tayo inspects a food label with a magnifying glass; Safi holds up a bag of crisps and a seasoning cube.</p>
  <p><strong>Tayo:</strong> “Many snacks, instant noodles, and certain spice mixes hide lots of salt!”</p>
  <p><strong>Safi:</strong> “Checking food labels for ‘low sodium’ or ‘no salt added’ helps us choose wisely.”</p>
  <p><strong>Baba (smiling):</strong> “With practice, reading labels becomes easy. Together, we’ll outsmart sneaky salt!”</p>
</div>

<div class="panel">
  <p class="panel-title">Page 4: Tasty Alternatives</p>
  <p><strong>Scene:</strong> In the kitchen again, Safi sprinkles herbs over a dish of grilled veggies, while Tayo squeezes lime over some chopped tomatoes.</p>
  <p><strong>Safi:</strong> “Herbs like ginger, garlic, and thyme add wonderful flavour without extra salt!”</p>
  <p><strong>Tayo (sniffing the aroma):</strong> “Mmm! This smells amazing. I never knew we could make food this tasty with less salt!”</p>
  <p><strong>Baba (holding a jug of water and a bowl of fruit):</strong> “Swap salty snacks for fresh fruit, and choose water over soda. Natural flavours can surprise you!”</p>
</div>

<div class="panel">
  <p class="panel-title">Page 5: The Market Mystery</p>
  <p><strong>Scene:</strong> The trio steps into a bustling African market. Suddenly, the Salt Monster appears, made of packaged foods, grinning mischievously.</p>
  <p><strong>Salt Monster:</strong> “Mwahaha! You’ll never avoid my salty grip!”</p>
  <p><strong>Safi (boldly):</strong> “Think again, Salt Monster! We have fresh produce, herbs, and knowledge on our side!”</p>
  <p><strong>Tayo (holding fresh mangoes and beans):</strong> “With these choices, we don’t need your extra salt!”</p>
  <p><strong>Salt Monster (shrinking):</strong> “Nooo… my power fades before your healthy habits!”</p>
</div>

<div class="panel">
  <p class="panel-title">Page 6: Fun Facts & Ideas</p>
  <p><strong>Scene:</strong> Tayo stands by a chalkboard with fun facts written on it.</p>
  <p><strong>Tayo:</strong> “Did you know most sodium comes from packaged foods, not the saltshaker?”</p>
  <p><strong>Safi:</strong> “Kids need less salt than adults. Reading labels helps us stay under healthy limits!”</p>
  <p><strong>Baba (pointing to a food label):</strong> “Look for less than 5% DV (Daily Value) of sodium—this means it’s low!”</p>
</div>

<div class="panel">
  <p class="panel-title">Page 7: Simple Recipes</p>
  <p><strong>Scene:</strong> Safi and Tayo making a fresh tomato salsa with onions, peppers, lime juice, and herbs.</p>
  <p><strong>Safi:</strong> “Try this tomato salsa—no salt, just flavourful herbs and lime!”</p>
  <p><strong>Tayo (tasting a spoonful):</strong> “Wow, so fresh and zesty! I don’t miss the salt at all!”</p>
  <p><strong>Baba (offering a bowl of unsalted popcorn):</strong> “See? Snacks can be fun and healthy without extra salt.”</p>
</div>

<div class="panel">
  <p class="panel-title">Page 8: The Salt Buster Pledge</p>
